This web proxy implementation in C sets up a server that listens for incoming client connections on a specified port. The serve function initializes a socket, binds it to the port, and listens for incoming connections. When a client connects, the server accepts the connection and handles it using the handle_client function. This function reads the client's HTTP request, parses it to extract the domain and port, and then forwards the request to the appropriate remote server using the forward_request function. After handling the request, the client connection is closed. The parse_request function checks if the client's request is a valid HTTP GET request and extracts the domain and port from the URL. If the port is not specified, it defaults to port 80. The create_proxy_request function formats the client's request to be compatible with the remote server by adding necessary headers. The forward_request function resolves the domain name to an IP address, establishes a connection to the remote server, sends the formatted request, and relays the server's response back to the client. Throughout the process, error handling is implemented to log errors and ensure the server continues to accept new connections. It handles all the reading and writing of data using the RIO library.
